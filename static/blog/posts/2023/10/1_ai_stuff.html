          </h2>
          <p>
            At its core, AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks
            that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include
            problem-solving, learning from experience, understanding natural
            language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. AI is a
            multidisciplinary field that draws from computer science,
            mathematics, psychology, and more.

          </h2>
          <p>
            One of the key drivers of AI's recent breakthroughs is
            <strong>machine learning</strong>. Machine learning algorithms
            enable computers to analyze vast amounts of data, recognize
            patterns, and make predictions or decisions without explicit
            programming. This approach has revolutionized fields like image and
            speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation
            systems.
