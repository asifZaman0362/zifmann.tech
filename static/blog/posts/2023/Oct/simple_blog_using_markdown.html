          <p>
            I've always wanted to have a blog of my own where I can write about
            things I love. Share my <em>experiences</em> and
            <em>experiments</em>. A place of my own, for me and my thoughts. I
            never cared for having a large reader-base and stuff like that and I
            still don't. There's a very high probability that this blog post
            itself will never be read by anyone and that's okay. The purpose of
            this blog is not to have people read it (although that would be
            nice), it is to have something out there, just for the sake of
            putting something out there. I don't know if anyone else can relate.
            I no-one does, thats alright too. But enough with all that. Let's
            write ourselves a blogging site, shall we?
          </p>
          <h2>
            <a
              href="<tag>design</tag>"
              aria-hidden="true"
              class="anchor"
              id="section-design"
            ></a
            >Design
          </h2>
          <p>
            Now I wasn't going to include this section here but I thought to
            myself:
            <em
              >I like design. I'm not very good at it but I dabble. And maybe
              other people do too.</em
            >
            So, if you're one of those people who do in fact like to think about
            design from time to time, follow along. And if you don't get design
            or simply don't care for it and are instead of unlocking my secrets,
            you may skip ahead.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <a
              href="<tag>inspiration</tag>"
              aria-hidden="true"
              class="anchor"
              id="section-inspiration"

            >Inspiration
          </h3>
          <p>
            There are many ways of going about this. The web is full of
            eye-catching blogs with colorful design and fancy animations. Before
            designing my own, I went on a little expedition of my own across the
            web, hunting for inspiration. I found blogs about pets with cute pet
            specific design, like a dog's paw for a cursor, cardboard
            cutout-like images for borders, etc. I found many blogs about tech
            and software which are generally more, how shall I put it,
            <em>modern</em> looking. These websites had a lot more procedural
            animations on things like buttons, links, forms etc. The general
            design trend was more, for the lack of a better term,
            <em>techy</em>. From high contrast colors, to gradient loading bars
            (by Ysmir! there was a lot of loading), to all those fancy
            animations I mentioned earlier. And another pattern I noticed was
            that they appeared to lean towards the more extreme ends of
            geometrical spectrum.
            <span class="term">Note: this is not a note, actually</span> By
            which I mean, they made use of either extremely sharp angles or
            intensely rounded corners. But there was no in-between. And there
            was also a lot of wasted space. Now I recently watched a video that
            explored how western graphic design is more generous in terms of
            using their screen real estate compared to their asian counterparts
            which are, on the other hand, more densely packed. I wanted my
            website to land somewhere in-between. Keeping things nice and
            compact while at the same time, not packing too much information in
            a small space so to overwhelm the reader.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Do we have anything like that that we can take inspiration from?
              Perhaps something that we started using from an early age as the
              primary source of information? (well, before the internet, that
              is)</em
            >
            Wait, I know. Its <strong>books</strong>!!
          </p>
          <p>
            Books have been around for, how long now? enturies. We have all read
            a book at some point in our lives. And I know most people think they
            are boring and there's a whole another discussion to be had about
            making books and information consumption more exciting. What we care
            about here though, is the text and how its layed out. Books are
            simple. And even though those 5000 lines of css you used to make
            your website look cool with a dynamic gradient background that
            reacts to the users interactions might get you nomated for an
            <em><strong>awwwards</strong></em
            >, it only really helps when you're trying to catch the attention of
            the user to sell a product. We're not selling anybody anything. We
            want to present the reader with a simple, easy-to-use and
            understand, <strong>accessible</strong> web page that can be read
            even by a scraping script without much difficulty. And if that means
            doing away with some of the <em>pizazz</em>, I wouldn't mind it. So,
            I want my blog to look like a book. With an overview of the post on
            the left to help with quick navigation. This overview should contain
            a hierarchical outline of the constituent sections of the post. I
            spent some time fiddling with the css and managed to create a tree
            like view using <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> elements and some
            pseudo-element hacking. Its fairly simple and it has a valid
            semantic structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            A while back, I was reading this book called
            <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html"
              >game programming patterns</a
            >
            which has a similar look and feel with what I was going for. An
            interesting thing I picked up from there was the way they made use
            of the extra space on the right hand side. See, in most websites,
            there is a tendency to keep your main content centred on screen with
            a fixed maximum width that it can span and there are
            <a
              href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/104705/why-do-many-sites-leave-half-of-each-webpage-empty"
              >valid reasons</a
            >
            for it. The game programming patterns website, makes use of this
            excess space on the right by attaching floating memos and notes to
            it. I really liked that idea so I wanted to include that in my blog
            too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that I had a clear vision of what I wanted my blog to look like,
            I made some drafts in Figma until I was satisfied with the way it
            looked.

          <p>
            I don't want my blog to use some fancy javascript UI framework or
            some content management system. I already have a webserver I wrote
            using the actix-web library in Rust for my main website and I don't
            want to write another. I want the <code>blog</code> route in my
            already existing webserver to serve static files from the
            <code>public/blog</code> directory. I may have to employ a database
            of some sort to keep track of when a blog was posted because I want
            to chronologically categorise my blog in the homepage. I already
            have a database handler, so all I have to do is to just add a new
            table like such:
          </p>
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>filename</th>
                <th>date</th>
                <th>categories</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>blog1</td>
                <td>Jan 20, 2023</td>
                <td>tech, blog</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
            Which should be enough for my needs. Now all I need is a way to
            parse a markdown document, and put parsed html content inside the
            <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> content of a template skeleton. For
            parsing the markdown files, I found this rust crate called
            <a href="https://docs.rs/comrak">comrak</a> which has some nice
            plugins and extensions that we can use to create things like
            task-lists, programming language specification inside
            <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags, stuff like that. I couldn't find a
            way to parse hash tags with this crate so I might have to do that in
            the post processing part. The neat thing about comrak is that there
            are two ways you can go about converting your markdown to html. You
            can either use the <code>markdown_to_html!</code> macro or, you can
            use some of the API functions to have comrak return you a parsed AST
            instead which you can then manipulate to say, substituting tags, or
            something like that. We can use this to add syntax highlighting to
            our <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks using a syntax highlighter I
            wrote a few days back for my own programming language I am
            designing. So, now that we have a way of parsing markdown and
            getting html from it, lets move on to the next item on our agenda:
            writing blogs.
          </p>
          <h2>
            <a
              href="<tag>obsidian</tag>"
              aria-hidden="true"
              class="anchor"
              id="section-obsidian"
            ></a
            >Obsidian
          </h2>
          <p>
            I mean sure, you can write markdown in a simple text editor. Before
            I used markdown, I would just write it in my text editor just like
            any other text file. It is, after all, a plaintext file format. But
            being able to see what your article would look like, as you are in
            the process of writing it, can be very helpful. And some things like
            tables, for example, can be a bit difficult to do with just a text
            editor. So, I used Obsidian instead. Obisidian has a few plugins
            that allow exporting directly to HTML from Obsidian itself, but none
            of the plugins that I tried fit my needs, so I decided to not use
            any of them and stick to parsing the document myself.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <a

          <p>
            What should a typical blog post on this site look like? I thought
            about that myself and arrived at the conclusion that every blog post
            should have a title (obviously), a set of tags right below the title
            that can be used for categorising and navigation, and the main
            contents of the article underneath it. No comments, no replies. But,
            in case someone does happen to find any of the articles interesting
            and would like to talk about it or provide suggestions, offer
            corrections or opinions or whatever, I will leave a
            <strong>share</strong> and
            <strong>discuss over email</strong> buttons at the bottom which I
            think are pretty self-explanatory. The share button just copies the
            link to the article while the discuss button prompts for an email
            with the post title as the subject. Neat!
